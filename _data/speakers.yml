    bio: >
      David Cox is an Assistant Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology and of Computer Science, and is a member of the Center for Brain Science at Harvard University. He completed his Ph.D. in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT with a specialization in computational neuroscience. Prior to joining MCB/CBS, he was a Junior Fellow at the Rowland Institute at Harvard, a multidisciplinary institute focused on high-risk, high-reward scientific research at the boundaries of traditional fields. His laboratory seeks to understand the computational underpinnings of high-level visual processing through concerted efforts in both reverse- and forward-engineering. To this end, his group employs a wide range of experimental techniques to probe natural systems, while at the same time actively developing practical computer vision systems based on what is learned about the brain.

    bio: >
      Kenji Doya is a Professor at Neural Computation Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University. He received his BS in 1984, MS in 1986, and Ph.D. in 1991 at the U. Tokyo. He joined the Advanced Telecommunications Research International (ATR) in 1994 and became the head of Computational Neurobiology Department, ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in 2003. In 2004, he was appointed as the Principal Investigator of Neural Computation Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) and started Okinawa Computational Neuroscience Course (OCNC) as the chief organizer. He currently leads the MEXT project “Artificial Intelligence and Brain Science”. He is interested in understanding the functions of basal ganglia and the cortical circuit based on the theory of reinforcement learning and Bayesian inference.

  - name: Alona Fyshe

    affiliation: University of Alberta

    bio: >
     Alona Fyshe is an Assistant Professor in the Computing Science and Psychology Departments at the University of Alberta, and a fellow at the Alberta Institute for Machine Learning (amii).  Alona received her BSc and MSc in Computing Science from the University of Alberta, and a PhD in Machine Learning from Carnegie Mellon University.  Alona uses machine learning to analyze brain images collected while people read, which allows her to study how humans represent the meaning they encounter in text, and how they combine words to understand higher-order meaning.  Alona also studies how computers learn to represent meaning when trained on text or images.  Alona has discovered interesting connections between meaning representations in computer models and those in the human brain.  Those connections serve to advance both our understanding of the brain, and the state of the art in machine learning.

  - name: Jack Gallant

    bio: >
     Jack Gallant is the Chancellor's Professor and Class of 1940 Endowed Chair in the Department of Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, as well as the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He received his BS from UC Berkeley and PhD from Yale University, and then did post-doctoral work at Caltech and Washington University under David van Essen. Jack's work focuses on using natural stimuli, including natural images, movies, and language, to build computational models of sensory processing. A method for decoding visual stimuli from fMRI responses developed in his lab was recognized as one of Time Magazine's Inventions of the Year in 2011.
